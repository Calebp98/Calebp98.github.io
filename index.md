## Hello and welcome to my blog.

I studied engineering in undergrad but love learning new things and if you have found this blog I imagine you do too. I made this blog to share some of the things that I am learning/working on with people who are interested.

I imagine that it will be a bit of an eclectic mix of computer science topics (such as deep reinforcement learning), philosophy (particulalry around the themes of [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/)) and short bursts of other topics. When I have more content I will try to curate articles into sensible streams but until then I will be embracing the chaos!



## Projects

I often find that if I want to cement my understanding of a topic, it helps to
have a project where I am applying that knowledge. Here is a set
of some of the projects I found interesting.

### Completed

* [physNet](https://devpost.com/software/physionet)
\- Web app designed to help physiotherapists monitor their patients from their
homes *Tensorflow.js, Computer Vision, p5, ml5, node.js*
* [What's your problem](https://devpost.com/software/what-s-your-problem)
\- Web app built for [Upping your Elvis](https://www.uppingyourelvis.com/), Hackmed 2020 winner *Tensorflow, flask*
* [th3g00d.space](https://devpost.com/software/th3g00d-space)
\- Web app for gesture based passwords, HackSheff 2019 winner *Tensorflow, Computer Vision, flask, Google Cloud*
* [Learning ASL using Transfer Learning](https://devpost.com/software/covhack19)
\- Web app for using transfer learning to recognise ASL for text based adventure game, HackCov 2019 winner *Tensorflow.js, Computer Vision, flask*



### Current
* [Conquer the World](https://github.com/JamesDHW/CTW) - Native app for
multiplayer game where players compete to mark the most territory.
* [Multiplayer Fun!](https://github.com/Calebp98/multiplayerGame) - Express app
using websockets for real time gameplay where players score points by tagging other players.
* [Interpreter Project](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/) - I thought following [these tutorials](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/) was a way to learn more about compilers and interpreters (and therefore computers).
* [Spinning Up in Deep RL](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/) - I think that deep reinforcement represents one of the most promising paths to artificial general intelligence. Even if it doesn't some labs have achieved [pretty](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphastar-mastering-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii) [amazing](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/) [results](https://openai.com/progress/) using deep RL. I am working through Open AI's resources to learn more about how to get agents that we build do the things we want and not things we don't want ([AI control problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_control_problem)).

### Technical Writing

* [ML Approaches to Dementia Assessment](https://actaneurocomms.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40478-019-0858-4) - \(peer-reviewed publication\) supervised by [Dennis Wang](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/medicine/people/neuroscience/dennis-wang).

* [Agent-based modelling and multi-agent systems](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vsccYW0N7Mt7xLJURUl8U4mhBoQyBw1O/view?usp=sharing)

* [Classification of the EMNIST Dataset via Competitive Learning](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pI40ETUCC2W7viSdWN-5rEDeinzqgRzo/view?usp=sharing)

* [On and Off Policy Approaches to Reinforcement Learning Using Chess](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BhR2fk2Mx0MFhYsFuF2ij36lyInXHP1C/view?usp=sharing)

* [Biologically Inspired Spiking Neural Networks for Signal Processing and Classification](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F5dYXYh88d9vw5vTYYn2EMT95H_SdMKr/view?usp=sharing)
