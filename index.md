## Hello and welcome to my blog.

I am an engineer by training but love to learning new things and if you have found this blog I imagine you do too. I made this blog to share some of the things that I am learning/working on with people who are interested.

I imagine that it will be a bit of an eclectic mix of computer science topics (such as deep reinforcement learning), philosophy (particulalry around the themes of [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/)) and short bursts of other topics. When I have more content I will try to curate articles into sensible streams but until then I will be embracing the chaos!

## Projects

I often find that if I want to cement my understanding of a topic, it helps to
have a project where I am applying that knowledge. I have also found that I have
learnt more than I expected from projects that I was already doing. Here is a set
of some of the projects I am most proud of.
