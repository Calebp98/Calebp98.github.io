## Hello and welcome to my blog/project site/whatever.

I run a [grantmaking organisation](https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/apply-for-funding). In 2022 we moved over $35M to effective charities in global health and development, animal welfare and mitigating catastrophic risks from emerging technologies.

My work is largely driven by trying to do as much good as I can with [radical empathy](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/QMrYGgBvg64JhcQrS/p/ehZK259et52Xnvw5F), [scope sensitivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_neglect) and a [scout mindset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scout_Mindset).
