## Hello and welcome to my blog/project site/whatever.

I currently run a [grantmaking organisation](https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/apply-for-funding).

If I decide to post regularly here I imagine that it will be an eclectic mix of computer science topics (such as deep reinforcement learning), philosophy (particulalry around the themes of [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/)) and short bursts of other topics.


## Projects

I often find that if I want to cement my understanding of a topic, it helps to
have a project where I am applying that knowledge. Here is a set
of some of the projects I found interesting.

### Current or on hold
* [Interpreter Project](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/) - I thought following [these tutorials](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/) was a way to learn more about compilers and interpreters.
