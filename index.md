I run a [grantmaking organisation](https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/apply-for-funding) which moved over $35M to high-impact projects in global health and development, animal welfare and global catastrophic risk reduction in 2022. I am currently most interested in mitigating risks from advanced artificial intelligence which I believe [could dramatically limit humanity's future potential on our current trajectory](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pRkFkzwKZ2zfa3R6H/without-specific-countermeasures-the-easiest-path-to).

My work is largely driven by trying to do as much good as I can with [radical empathy](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/QMrYGgBvg64JhcQrS/p/ehZK259et52Xnvw5F), [scope sensitivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_neglect) and a [scout mindset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scout_Mindset).
